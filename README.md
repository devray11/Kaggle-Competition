# Kaggle Competitions 

This repository showcases my work on Kaggle machine learning competitions.
Each competition is documented with reproducible code, clear evaluation metrics,
and publicly verifiable leaderboard performance.

This ReadMe is intended to demonstrate applied machine learning skills,
problem-solving ability, and disciplined experimentation across different
problem domains.
